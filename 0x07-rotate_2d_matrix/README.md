# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix
## Description

This project is part of the curriculum for the Short Specialization course at Holberton School. It focuses on solving the problem of rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise.

The goal of this project is to implement a function rotate_2d_matrix(matrix) that takes an n x n 2D matrix as input and rotates it 90 degrees clockwise in-place. The matrix will be modified directly, and no new matrix will be created.

## Requirements
- The function rotate_2d_matrix must be implemented according to the provided prototype: def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix).
- The matrix should be modified in-place; no new matrix should be created.
- The matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.10)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.8.0)
- You are not allowed to import any module
- All modules and functions must be documented
- All your files must be executable
